          <h2>What is a Pet Influencer?</h2>
          <p class="blogTextAlign">
              One of the great things about nosing around the pet industry for over a decade, is the fascinating pleasure of watching it evolve. Plus, since I’m not just in the pet industry, but a marketing person too – I’ve watched that world change over the 12+ years I’ve been helping businesses get noticed. Let me say, what a time to be in marketing in the pet industry!
              <br>
              One of the most exciting alignments between these two worlds is happening right now, as we speak. What is it you ask? It is the wild, wooly and very profitable world of the ‘pet influencer’. I know many of you are curious about what it is, and what it means to be a pet influencer, so today I wanted to shed some light on this mysterious concept.
              <br>
              <br>
              The most common reference I hear and see in the pet world, when referring to a ‘pet influencer’, is an ‘insta-famous’ dog, cat or other critter who has a large following on Instagram (usually 10k+) and gets paid for ‘sponsored’ posts, ‘celebrity’ appearances and endorsements. However, having an insta-famous pet is not the only way to create influence in the pet industry. In fact, I’d say that if you are a pet writer, pet podcaster, pet youtuber, pet blogger or pet photographer, you are MUCH more suited to become an ‘influencer’ than a pet parent with a frenchie and an iPhone. You, the storytellers, have a decided edge in the influencer game.

          <h2>What is the ‘Product’ of an ‘Influencer’?</h2>
          <p class="blogTextAlign">
              The product of any influencer, is obviously influence. But that’s intangible right? How do you monetize influence? Well, primarily in these three ways:
                <ol>
                  <li>Content</li>
                  <li>Appearances</li>
                  <li>Endorsements & Sponsorships</li>
                </ol>
          </p>
          <p class="blogTextAlign">
              Typically ‘content’ includes: articles, photos, videos and audio. Sometimes one at a time, sometime all mixed together. Can you see why I mentioned that writers, podcasters, youtubers, bloggers and photographers have an advantage here? If you are a storyteller, you already have the hardest (and most expensive to outsource) skills required to be a successful influencer.
              <br>
              <br>
              At Superzoo this year I had the opportunity to meet Manny the Frenchie and the Dogist, two of the biggest pet influencers of the moment. They were at Superzoo on behalf of pet brands who had hired them to be in their booth to draw buyers, press and attention generally in their direction. Influencers get paid to show up, smile and take selfies.
              <br>
              <br>
              Often Endorsements and Sponsorship lead back to content- especially if you’re endorsing a partner on your own media (ie your own instagram, blog, website, youtube channel, podcast, whatever) or it is a sponsored trip or experience that you’re creating content about.

          <h2>How Do I Become a Pet Influencer?</h2>
          <p class="blogTextAlign">
              In addition to being able to produce the ‘products’ of an influencer, there is an even more important element to becoming successful at building and wielding influence.
              <br>
              <br>
              I mentioned earlier that I met Manny the Frenchie (well technically Manny’s dad, the human behind his instagram account) and the Dogist… Sure it was fun to get that selfie (and get tweeted by Manny), but I can tell you, there is nothing remarkable about the humans behind the instagram-led fame of these two influencers. They are not superhuman geniuses.They are very different people, with totally different platforms of influence… The Dogist doesn’t even have a dog!
              <br>
              <br>
              Surprised? You shouldn’t be. It’s not a miracle that these guys built audiences in the multi-millions… They are marketers at heart. Whether or not they set out to be influencers, their brains are wired to build audiences and lead interesting conversations. They’re naturals at consistency. They have a knack for telling stories… For leading a movement.
